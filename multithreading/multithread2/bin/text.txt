One day Nicole comes home and sees her parents and her sister in the living room. She sees new things: a guitar, a trumpet, and a piano. Nicole is very surprised! "Wow!" she says, "What is this?"

"Well," her father answers, "we see that we can't beat you, so we decide to join you!"
er parents tell her, "Nicole, we are happy that you like the drums, but you can't play the drums all the time. There are other people in the apartment. There are other people in the building. There are other people in the neighborhood. And they all want to sleep sometimes!

Nicole listens to them. She says she understands, but she doesn't stop doing it. She practices playing the drums all the time!

Her parents complain, her sister complains, the neighbors complain. Even the cat complains!

"Ok, ok!" Nicole says, "I will be a good girl. I will do it more quietly."

But this doesn't help much. No one can work, no one can rest, and no one can sleep.

"Ok, ok!" Nicole says, "I will be a good girl. I will do it more quietly."

But this doesn't help much. No one can work, no one can rest, and no one can sleep.

One day Nicole comes home and sees her parents and her sister in the living room. She sees new things: a guitar, a trumpet, and a piano. Nicole is very surprised! "Wow!" she says, "What is this?"

"Well," her father answers, "we see that we can't beat you, so we decide to join you!"er parents tell her, "Nicole, we are happy that you like the drums, but you can't play the drums all the time. There are other people in the apartment. There are other people in the building. There are other people in the neighborhood. And they all want to sleep sometimes!

Nicole listens to them. She says she understands, but she doesn't stop doing it. She practices playing the drums all the time!

Her parents complain, her sister complains, the neighbors complain. Even the cat complains!

"Ok, ok!" Nicole says, "I will be a good girl. I will do it more quietly."
